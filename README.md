##Description
Hi, everyone
I made website that anyone can write anything without any identity. 
It is website that people can write that the king has donkey ears.

You can write whatever you want in any language. Secret, love message, criticism, or bad words etc. 

There will be small bubble with the message, and then it will disappear. 
The messages save to database, and you can see on the background of site. 

Write something in your mind, and relieve your stress. 

It is test version, and running on aws. 

If you find a bug or interested on this project, please PM me anytime.
Thanks.
